# Mapping two sets of points in 3D space 

### This is a simple attempt to learn a mapping between two sets of points -- an exercise in Linear regresson.  


 Data points (X) is generated by random generation. An arbitrary rotation/translation is applied to generate another set of points (Y). Some noise is added to Y.

 The rotation/translation parameters are calculated by using Scipy.optimize.

 The mapping is learned by a DL model. GridSearchCV is used to optimize hyperparameters.
